  India’s Pharmacy Empire in Africa: Public Health, Colonial Echoes, and the Scourge of Drug Abuse

  
    India’s transformation into the “pharmacy of the world” is lauded by many as a marvel of modern industrial policy—a shining example of South-South cooperation reshaping access to lifesaving medicines. Nowhere is this global pivot more consequential than in Africa, where the uneven terrains of public health, industry, and state capacity have been long shaped by colonial extraction and underdevelopment. Indian generics now underpin essential medical care across the continent, but woven into this tapestry of progress are threads of dependency, profit, and exploitation that disturbingly mirror the logics of empire.
  

  
    Over the past two decades, India’s pharmaceutical exports to Africa soared from $0.75 billion in 2007 to $3.93 billion in 2025, a fivefold leap that propelled India into Africa’s pharmaceutical core (1). In just the last financial year, Africa accounted for more than 83% of India’s total pharma exports to the continent, with South Africa leading as the continent’s top import destination (2, 3). The most remarkable surge spanned 2010–2016, when Indian generics radically democratized access to antiretrovirals, antibiotics, insulin, vaccines, and malaria drugs—medicines that most African nations lacked the infrastructure to produce at scale, thanks to decades of colonial neglect and postcolonial underinvestment (1, 2, 5).
  

  Colonial Continuities: How Dependency Was Engineered

  
    This reliance on Indian supply did not arise in a policy vacuum. Throughout colonial rule, industrial power in Africa was systematically dismantled or forestalled. Local economies were recast to maximize resource flow to Europe, while sectors essential for self-determination—like pharmaceuticals—were denied development to cement Africa’s role as a captive import market. Even after independence, these structural constraints endured (5). Most African states still lack the scale, technical depth, and regulatory space for building indigenous drug manufacturing—and remain at the mercy of global price shocks, patents, or shifting priorities in Delhi, Mumbai, and beyond.
  

  
    India’s rapid ascendancy as Africa’s chief supplier was no accident. Leveraging state-backed export incentives, a tradition of reverse engineering, and vast manufacturing scale, Indian pharma giants filled the vacuum left by retreating Western firms. The impact was especially glaring during the COVID-19 pandemic: as rich nations hoarded vaccines and active ingredients, Indian exports to Africa hit $3.92 billion in 2021. South Africa alone received $669 million in Indian pharmaceuticals in 2024, while new growth markets emerged in Malawi, Kenya, and Namibia (4).
  

  Drug Abuse: The Shadow Pipeline

  
    Yet alongside these public health achievements lies a deepening crisis of drug abuse, trafficking, and pharmaceutical dumping. Echoing colonial powers' historic use of addictive substances for profit and control, investigative journalists have found Indian firms—most notably Aveo Pharmaceuticals—involved in exporting unlicensed, addictive drug cocktails to African markets. These “grey market” products, frequently combining opioids like tapentadol with carisoprodol (a muscle relaxant banned in Europe), are sold under local brand names and draw their primary clientele from Africa’s youth (6, 7).
  
  
    The results are devastating. Nigeria now counts an estimated four million opioid abusers, with similar trends reported in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. These substances, initially legal exports, easily slip through the cracks of fragmented border controls and weak regulatory regimes—a legacy of colonial statecraft. Overdose rates, respiratory illnesses, and social disintegration are the direct outcomes. The BBC captured Indian pharma executives on tape candidly discussing marketing these pills to teenagers and shrugging off the lethality as “just business" (6, 7).
  

  Profits and Power: Extraction Updated
  
    The profits—on both legal and illicit pharmaceutical exports—overwhelmingly return to Indian companies and intermediaries, while African communities bear the disproportionate cost in public health harms and social instability. Local officials and sellers may pocket short-term gains, but the broader outcome is familiar: youth addicted, communities destabilized, and health systems overrun by crises manufactured abroad. It’s a script that recalls empire: a periphery exposed to risk for the center’s gain.
  
  
    All the while, African governments and NGOs remain locked into this supply relationship, still reliant on Indian sources for affordable ARVs, antibiotics, and vaccines. This dependency weakens their leverage to demand better oversight, stricter quality, or redress for the harms of illicit drug flows. The same infrastructure wiring public health can, when left unchecked, double as a vector for exploitation and destabilization.
  
  
    India frames these exports as “humanitarian pharmaceutical diplomacy,” echoing old colonial justifications of “civilizing” or “modernizing" the periphery while retaining key patents, capital, and research offshore. Joint ventures and know-how transfer agreements are often celebrated but rarely shift the core architectures of power, technology, and production. When international supply chains are stressed—as during COVID-19—African nations are reminded of their vulnerability, long queues for vaccines and essential medicines, and the volatility of outsourced care.
  

  Breaking Dependency: Toward Health Sovereignty
  
    If Africa is to transcend this renewed colonial dynamic, the answer is not more favorable import contracts or humanitarian donations, but a commitment to local production, regional regulatory harmonization, workforce development, and a new politics of health sovereignty. Only by investing in real capacity and rewriting the rules of pharmaceutical engagement can the continent break free from a model that profits from both illness and exploitation.
