  <h1>🇪🇹 Ethiopia’s Revolution: From Empire to the Downfall of the Derg</h1>

  <p>Ethiopia’s modern history is a <span class="highlight">saga of fire and hope</span>, marked by the clash of old empires and the dreams of a new generation. In the 20th century, this ancient land was transformed not by the slow hand of reform, but by the thunder of revolution—by students marching in the streets, workers striking in the factories, and rebels fighting in the mountains. The story of Ethiopia’s revolution is not just about the fall of emperors or the rise of generals; it is about the courage and heartbreak of ordinary people who demanded a different future.</p>

  <h2>The Last Emperor and the Seeds of Discontent</h2>

  <p>For centuries, Ethiopia was ruled by the Solomonic dynasty, a monarchy that claimed descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Emperor Haile Selassie, the last of this line, was revered abroad as a symbol of African independence. Yet, beneath the surface, his empire rested on a deeply feudal foundation. Land was concentrated in the hands of aristocrats and the Orthodox Church, while millions of peasants—especially among the Oromo, Tigrayan, Somali, and Sidama peoples—lived in crushing poverty. Calls for reform were met with silence or violence.</p>

  <p>The real breaking point came in the early 1970s, when famine ravaged the northern provinces of Wollo and Tigray. The imperial government’s denial and mishandling of the crisis shattered its legitimacy. As the world discovered the hidden suffering, a generation of Ethiopians was radicalized—not just by the horror of hunger, but by the realization that their rulers would rather hide the truth than save lives. The seeds of revolution had been sown.</p>

  <h2>Students and Workers: The Heartbeat of Revolution</h2>

  <p>By the 1960s, the winds of change were sweeping through Ethiopian universities. Inspired by global anti-colonial movements and Marxist thought, students became the conscience of the nation. They rallied under slogans like <span class="highlight">"Land to the tiller!"</span> and <span class="highlight">"Down with feudalism!"</span>—demanding not just reform, but a total transformation of Ethiopian society. Underground newspapers circulated, strikes erupted, and the streets of Addis Ababa became battlegrounds between youth and imperial police. The 1969 assassination of student leader Tilahun Gizaw was a turning point, turning grief into rage and galvanizing thousands to action.</p>

  <p>Workers, too, found their voice. The Confederation of Ethiopian Labor Unions (CELU) organized strikes that paralyzed the economy and showed that the revolution was not just a student affair. By 1975, just months after the emperor’s fall, a general strike swept the country, proving that the call for change had reached every corner of society.</p>

  <h2>The Derg’s Rise: From Hope to Betrayal</h2>

  <p>The revolution exploded in February 1974, when mutinous soldiers in Negele Borana ignited a wave of unrest that swept through Addis Ababa and beyond. Taxi drivers, teachers, and students joined the uprising, and by September, the once-untouchable emperor was overthrown. Into the power vacuum stepped the Derg, a committee of junior military officers who promised to fulfill the revolution’s dreams. They declared a socialist state, launched sweeping land reforms, and nationalized major industries.</p>

  <p>But beneath the rhetoric, the Derg lacked a true revolutionary vision. Their rule quickly devolved into militarized authoritarianism, especially under the iron hand of Mengistu Haile Mariam. Rival leftist groups were branded as enemies, and the revolution’s ideals were betrayed in a storm of violence.</p>

  <h2>The Red Terror and the Shadow of War</h2>

  <p>The Derg’s rule was soon defined by fear. The infamous Red Terror of 1977–78 saw tens of thousands of students, workers, and suspected dissenters imprisoned, tortured, or executed. Mengistu’s regime claimed to be defending the revolution, but in reality, it was crushing the very forces that had made it possible.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Ogaden War with Somalia in 1977–78, fought with Soviet and Cuban support, militarized Ethiopian society even further and deepened ethnic divisions. The costs of war and repression were staggering, and the regime’s brutality became infamous worldwide.</p>

  <p>Then, in the mid-1980s, famine struck again. Over a million Ethiopians died, not just from drought, but from government mismanagement, forced resettlement, and the endless drain of war. The world watched in horror as Mengistu’s regime proved itself both cruel and incapable.</p>

  <h2>Resistance in the Mountains</h2>

  <p>Yet, even as the Derg tightened its grip, resistance flourished in the highlands and forests. The Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) waged a disciplined war for independence in the north. The Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), blending Marxist-Leninist ideals with Tigrayan nationalism, became a formidable force. The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and other groups demanded self-determination and justice, refusing to be silenced.</p>

  <p>By the late 1980s, the Derg’s power was crumbling. The economy was in ruins, the countryside was in revolt, and the Soviet Union—Mengistu’s last great patron—was itself collapsing. Major defeats on the battlefield, such as the EPLF’s victory at Afabet and the TPLF’s rout of Derg forces at Shire, signaled that the end was near.</p>

  <h2>The Fall of the Derg and the Dawn of a New Era</h2>

  <p>In 1991, the final act unfolded. A coalition led by the TPLF, known as the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), swept through the country and entered Addis Ababa. On May 28, 1991—Ginbot 20 in the Ethiopian calendar—the Derg was overthrown. Mengistu fled into exile in Zimbabwe, leaving behind a shattered nation.</p>

  <p>The EPRDF established a transitional government under Meles Zenawi, promising a new era of democracy and self-determination. The Transitional Charter enshrined the right of Ethiopia’s nations and nationalities to govern themselves, laying the groundwork for a federal system that endures to this day.</p>

  <h2>Lessons of a Revolution Interrupted</h2>

  <p>Ethiopia’s revolution is a story of both inspiration and tragedy. It began with genuine grassroots demands for justice and dignity, was hijacked by military men who wore socialism as a mask, and ended with a new elite in power—leaving many of the original dreams unfulfilled. Yet, the spirit of those who risked everything for a better Ethiopia still burns bright.</p>

  <p>The lesson is clear: <span class="highlight">No revolution can succeed without real democracy, accountability, and the power of the people.</span> Ethiopia’s journey reminds us that the struggle for justice is never finished—and that the courage of ordinary people can change the course of history.</p>
